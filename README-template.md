## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-Introduction to mobile-first workflow.
-Adding an image in the head section to show on the browswer tab.
-Creating a hyperlink and header combination.
-Practical use of interactive elements and their styling.
-adjusting letter spacing using em/rem - the numerical values are much lower than I expected.


```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./assets/images/favicon-32x32.png">
 <a href="https://youtu.be/WX1IZyZNMkM"><h2>HTML & CSS foundations</h2></a>
```
```css
h2:hover {
    color: var(--yellow);
    border-radius: 5px;
}

h2 {
    letter-spacing: 0.1em;
}
```

### Continued development

-More projects focusing on HTML and CSS to naturalise my approach.
-Complete course on responsive design and mobile-first workflow.

### Useful resources

This project was much simpler than my first challenge - I needed very little input from external sources, only using w3school to reference options a couple of times.
